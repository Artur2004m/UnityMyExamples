# Important information

All the files have been organized by a type system which can be found inside the Assets folder, except the source files (Which are in this folder).

## Main files

### Slugcat.blend

Can be opened with Blender, you can get it for free from the Steam page or through https://blender.org, it may not work correctly below version 2.79.

Contains the character itself with all the toggable features, the textures for the slugcat are already linked but can be found in Assets/Textures if you want to modify them, all of the objects and collections have been labeled and organized so you'll easily be able to tell what is what, it also brings a Rigify armature that's linked with the base armature through a plugin of mine that will be sold in the future, you can activate it in the "Rigify Retarget" header in the Objects panels, tick the Retarget Constraints button! that way you can animate whatever you like and export it back to the base armature in one click (The export options are in a subheader right below the buttons); All of the layers have been labeled as well and you can toggle them on and off in the right panel in the viewport (N to open). I will sell this plugin in the future so i'd really appreciate if you checked it out once it comes out if you want to make animation a lot easier!

KEEP IN MIND! If you want to use the animation features, you MUST allow the Python script that run when the Blend file gets loaded.

### .spp

Can be opened with Substance Painter, you can buy it on Steam (which you should), or get it as part of a subscription in Adobe's page. It may not open below version 2022.

Contains the texture work of the more complex objects of this base, such as the slugcat and other props, all of the layers have been named and organized as to make them easy to work with, don't be afraid to poke around them! Keep in mind all of the files have been saved with 256px texture resolution to make the file as small as possible, so as soon as you open it make sure to bump it up back to 2048. Keep in mind most of the layers are exported separately to allow for more complex interactions in Unity, so they may have varying resolutions.

If you're making your own textures, i would advise you not to go up to 4K since 2K can already give a lot of detail and it's also for the sake of optimization, but if you really really need to go that high up, go on.
